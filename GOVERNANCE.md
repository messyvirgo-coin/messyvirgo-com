# Governance (website repository)

This repository is the public website for Messy Virgo (`messyvirgo.com`). It is public for transparency, but it represents an official public-facing channel, so changes are **maintainer-led**.

## Roles

- **Maintainers**: review/merge pull requests and keep the site consistent, accurate, and safe.
- **Contributors**: anyone participating via issues/PRs under the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Decision making

- **Small changes** (typos, broken links, minor styling): can be merged by a maintainer after review.
- **Substantive changes** (tokenomics copy, legal/financial claims, brand/voice, major design changes, new pages): should start as an issue for discussion and may require explicit approval by maintainers.

## Contribution boundaries

- This repo is public, but **Messy Virgo retains editorial control** over website content and messaging.
- Non-maintainer PRs may be accepted when clearly beneficial, but may also be declined or asked to proceed with a maintainer sponsor.
- Maintainers may close issues/PRs that are out of scope (e.g. trading advice, spam, promotional content, harassment).

## Contacts

- **Maintainers**: `@messy-michael`, `@MessyFranco`
- **Project contact**: `contact@messyvirgo.com`
